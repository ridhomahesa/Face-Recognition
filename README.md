# Face-Recognition
Face Recognition Based on Texture Feature using Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). In this research used 8 types of texture features, namely mean, skewness, kurtosis, entropy, homogeneity, contrast, energy, correlation. For segment the face region, use Viola-Jones Algorithm. ANFIS Classifier produces up to 74% accuracy for face recognition problem.
